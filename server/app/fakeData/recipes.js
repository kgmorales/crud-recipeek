Add the onions, season with salt and sauté until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat as needed to avoid burning the onions.\n\nWhen onions are golden, add the tomato paste and garlic, stir until combined and a "fond" (the brown bits) is starting to develop on the bottom of the pot. Add the flour and stir until flour is mixed in, making a roux. It will look lumpy and weird at this point, that is OK!\n\nSlowly whisk in the beef broth until the flour roux is mixed in and the broth is smooth. Add 1/2 a cup of the Guinness, the brown sugar, and the fresh thyme. Whisk to combine.\n\nAdd the beef to the pot and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, transfer to the oven and roast, uncovered for 2 hours.\n\nAfter 2 hours, remove from oven and add the carrots and potatoes. Stir to arrange the beef so that different parts of it are sticking out of the stew - that way they can brown in the oven. Return stew to the oven for one more hour.\n\nRemove stew from oven. If beef is not as tender as you would like, you can continue to roast for another half hour. When finished cooking, stir in the remaining 3/4 cup of Guinness and fresh chopped parsley. Taste and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve.',

		directions:
			'For the Duxelles:\n\nTo make the Duxelles: Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add butter and olive oil to a large saute pan and set over medium heat. Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saute for 8 to 10 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.\n\nFor the Beef:\n\nTo prepare the beef: Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking. Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef. Using a rubber spatula cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles. Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves. When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard. Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it up nice and tight. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape. Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape.\n\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F.\n\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about a 1/4-inch thickness. Depending on the size of your sheets you may have to overlap 2 sheets and press them together. Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off plastic. Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef - saving ends to use as a decoration on top if desired. Top with coarse sea salt. Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet.\n\nBrush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife ¿ this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from oven and rest before cutting into thick slices. Garnish with minced chives, and serve with Green Peppercorn Sauce, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with Fresh Herbs and Garlic, and Warm Wilted Winter Greens.\n\nGreen Peppercorn Sauce:\n\nAdd olive oil to pan after removing beef. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme; saute for 1 to 2 minutes, then, off heat, add brandy and flambe using a long kitchen match. After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock and reduce by about half. Strain out solids, then add 2 cups cream and mustard. Reduce by half again, then shut off heat and add green peppercorns.\n\nRoasted Fingerling Potatoes with Fresh Herbs and Garlic:\n\nPreheat oven to 500 degrees F and place a baking sheet inside to heat.\n\nAdd potatoes, rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic to a medium bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Remove sheet pan from oven, lightly coat with olive oil, and pour potatoes onto pan. Place potatoes in oven and reduce heat to 425 degrees F. Roast for 20 minutes, or until crispy on outside and tender on inside.\n\nWarm Wilted Winter Greens:\n\nCook honey and balsamic together over medium-high heat in a large saute pan, about 5 minutes. Toast walnuts in a small skillet; set aside to cool.\n\nPile greens on a platter. Stir mustard into balsamic-honey dressing, then whisk in about 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil; pour over greens. Season greens with salt and pepper and garnish with walnuts, pomegranate seeds, shavings of Parmesan, and shallot.',

			'For the Cookies:\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Sift the dry ingredients into a medium bowl and set aside.\n\nUse an electric mixer to cream the brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla. Once smooth, slowly add the dry mixture to the wet mixture until well combined. Stir in the oats.\n\nUse a tablespoon-sized scoop to form equal dough balls. Allow them plenty of space to spread. Bake for 7-9 minutes. Let the cookies cool completely before moving off the parchment paper.\n\nFor the Filling:\n\nCream the shortening, powdered sugar, and vanilla together until smooth. Mix in the marshmallow fluff.\n\nTo Assemble:\n\nMatch up two cookies that are of equal size and shape. Turn the bottom cookies over. Use a piping bag (or zip-bag with the corner cut off) to pipe the filling onto the bottom cookie. This is much easier than trying to spread it. Add the top cookie of each cream pie and press down.',

Place 1½ Cups of Freeze Dried Strawberries into a food processor and process until it turns to powder (if you don’t have a food processor, place into a ziplock bag and crush into powder).\n\n*Watch my 30-second Instagram Recipe Video here\n\n2) Pour very cold Heavy Whipping Cream into the mixing bowl with the cream filing, add the Freeze Dried Strawberries powder and mix on low with the whisk attachment, for 30 seconds then increase to high speed until stiff peaks form. Texture should be similar to cool whip\n\n3) Line a 7 inch springform pan with parchment on the bottom and sides. Spread a thin layer of strawberry whipped cream on the bottom of the pan, then line the bottom of the pan with a layer of cookies. Add about ½ inch layer of whipped cream, then another layer of cookies. Repeat until you’ve used all the whipped cream, you should end up with a layer of whipped cream on top.\n\n4) Place 15 cookies and ⅓ Cup of Freeze Dried Strawberries into a ziplock bag, crush into chunky crumbs. Sprinkle this mixture on top of the cake. Cover the pan with foil and refrigerate for 3-4 hours. Unlatch the springform pan and remove the parchment on the sides. Decorate with fresh strawberries on top of the cake. Slice a few strawberries thinly and decorate with the slices around the base of the cake. Enjoy!',

			"The night before, add the dry beans to a large bowl with double their volume in water. Allow the beans to soak in the refrigerator overnight.\n\nWhen you're ready to start cooking, slice the sausage into rounds. Add the cooking oil and sliced sausage to a large pot and cook over medium until the sausage pieces are browned. Remove the cooked sausage with a slotted spoon to a clean bowl. Place the cooked sausage in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the dish.\n\nWhile the sausage is cooking, dice the onion, bell pepper, and celery. Mince the garlic.\n\nAfter removing the cooked sausage, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot. Sauté the vegetables over medium heat until the onions are soft, allowing the moisture from the vegetables to help dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the pot as you stir.\n\nAdd the smoked paprika, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, black pepper, and bay leaves to the pot. Stir and cook for one minute more.\n\nDrain and rinse the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with 6 cups water and give the pot a brief stir to combine the ingredients.\n\nPlace a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring it up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low, and let the pot boil for one hour, stirring occasionally. Replace the lid every time you stir.\n\nAfter boiling for one hour, the beans should be tender. Begin to smash the beans with the back of a spoon against the side of the pot. Continue smashing the beans and letting the pot simmer without a lid for 30 minutes to thicken the pot.\n\nWhile the beans are simmering for their final 30 minutes, cook the rice. Add the rice and 3 cups water to a sauce pot. Place a lid on top, turn the heat on to high, and bring it up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the rice simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice rest for 5 minutes without removing the lid. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.\n\nOnce the red beans have thickened, add the cooked sausage back to the pot along with 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley. Stir to combine. Taste the red beans and add salt to your liking. Start with 1 tsp and add more as needed. I used 1 Tbsp total (3 tsp).\n\nServe the red beans in a bowl topped with a scoop of rice and a sprinkle of sliced green onions.",

			'Expert Tips\n\nWhen cooking lasagna noodles for the recipe, remove them carefully from the water with tongs and lay them across a cutting board to dry and cool off. Don’t stack them, or they will stick together.\n\nWhen preparing your ingredients in the baking dish, try to cover your top row of lasagna noodles with cheese and/or sauce before baking. Exposed, naked noodles end up burnt and hard.\n\nBefore cutting your baked lasagna to serve, let it stand for 10-15 minutes after you remove it from the oven. This will help it hold it’s classic lasagna shape.\n\nShredded Romano can be substituted for shredded Parmesan cheese. It has a similar flavor, and usually costs less.\n\nIf using foil pans, this Lasagna can be quite heavy so make sure and put a cookie sheet underneath of it before you bake.\n\nNEVER thaw your freezer lasagna on the counter. Always in the fridge.',

Divide slices equally among 5 meal prep containers. Divide tabbouleh and tzatziki equally among meal prep containers, as well. Spoon about 2-3 tablespoons hummus or baba ganoush into each container, to taste, and top with about 5 kalamata olives.\n\nPlace grated cucumber (for tzatziki) on a paper towel and gather edges together.

			"Chop your cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces and measure out 2 cups. Add to a large bowl. If you like your chicken pot pie extra chicken-y feel free to add another cup or two to this pie.\n\nAlso add to bowl frozen hash-browns, frozen peas & carrots, diced onion (if using), 2 jars of gravy and season to taste with salt and pepper. ( I personally add 1-1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp pepper). Stir all together until well combined.\n\nRemove your store-bought pie crusts from their packages. If they need to come to room temperature first that's fine, just wait a few minutes.\n\nPlace one pie crust into each 9-inch pie plate. Spoon the pot pie filling equally between the two pie plates in the crust. Top with the second pie crusts. Seal the edges by crimping with a fork or your fingers. Poke a few holes with a sharp knife or fork on top pie crusts.\n\nMAKE IT NOW\n\nPreheat oven to 400°F degrees.\n\nOptional: use a pastry brush, and lightly brush crust and edges with beaten egg.\n\nPlace pot pie on a baking pan, place in middle rack of oven and bake for 35-40 minutes or until top of pie is golden and inside is bubbling. You could use a pie crust shield or cover edges with foil to protect the edges from browning if necessary. Cool for 10 minutes, cut into slices and serve.\n\nMAKE IT A FREEZER MEAL\n\nWrap unbaked chicken pot pies tightly in aluminum foil, then place in freezer. Freezes well for 4-6 months.\n\nTo bake from frozen, preheat oven to 400°F. Place pot pie on a baking sheet, place in middle rack of oven and bake, covered for 30 minutes. Remove the foil from the pie, then continue baking for 35-40 minutes or until top of pie is golden and inside is bubbling. You could use a pie crust shield or cover edges with foil to protect the edges from browning if necessary. Cool for 10 minutes, cut into slices and serve.\n\nTo thaw first & bake, place frozen pot pies into fridge for 24 hours. Bake at 400°F, covered for 20 minutes. Remove the foil from the pie, then continue baking for 35 minutes or until top of pie is golden and inside is bubbling. Cool for 10 minutes, cut into slices and serve.",

			'This recipe is easy to adapt to your family size and circumstances. You won’t need extra pie crusts, recipe is same for each of these. Here are some different sizes this recipe makes:\n\n6 Individual Sized Mini-Pie Pans (same bake time as 9-inch pies above)\n\nTwo 9-inch pie pans\n\nOne 9×13 inch baking pan – note: baking time will be longer – bake with foil for 45 minutes, remove foil and continue baking for an additional 45-50 minutes or until golden brown and bubbling inside.\n\nFor the chicken in the recipe: buy a rotisserie chicken or you can also cook up boneless skinless chicken breasts (place in baking pan with 1/4 cup water, bake covered for 1 hour at 350°F).\n\nIf you are planning on doing an egg wash, don’t add it before freezing. Instead brush it on right before adding the pie to the oven. I prefer the egg wash as it makes the pie look shiny and pretty.\n\nUse a metal or foil pan if going from freezer to a hot oven, as glass pans can shatter.\n\nHomemade gravy? If you are using up homemade vs store-bought gravy, use 2-1/2 cups of homemade.',

Let it cook for 2-3 minutes.\n\nAdd the sausage back into the pan. Cook for another few minutes until the sauce has thickened up a bit.\n\nStir in the basil and spinach. Let it cook for a minute or so until it wilts. Give the sauce a taste and season with extra salt & pepper if needed.\n\nDrain the pasta and toss it with the sauce. Serve immediately with some freshly grated parmesan if desired.",

			"Please see the recipe card below for the complete recipe, including measurements and baking time!\n\nSTEP ONE: Add the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla to a small bowl. Mix on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until fluffy and the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Scoop the cheesecake filling into 16, 2 teaspoon portions onto a small parchment paper lined baking sheet. Freeze the cheesecake balls until they are frozen and very firm.\n\nSTEP TWO: Then dry your pumpkin to get rid of excess moisture. This may seem weird but it is the only way these cookies will bake properly and not turn out cakey! Spread your pumpkin on a plate and place paper towels over the top. Lightly press to absorb the liquid. Repeat the step at least four more times until hardly any liquid transfers to the paper towel. (It needs to reduce down to just under ¼ cup from ½ cup). Then set aside.\n\nSTEP THREE: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Then set aside the flour mixture.\n\nSTEP FOUR: In a large bowl cream the softened butter and brown sugar together with an electric hand mixer on high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes.\n\nSTEP FIVE: Add in the egg yolks and vanilla and mix for one minute on medium speed until pale and fluffy.\n\nSTEP SIX: Add in the pumpkin and combine on medium speed.\n\nSTEP SEVEN: Add in the dry ingredients and combine on low speed.\n\nSTEP SEVEN: Scoop the dough into 16 portions with a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop, then roll into balls. Slightly flatten out each then place the frozen cheesecake ball in the center. Then close the cheesecake ball in with the cookie dough and roll into a ball again. Make sure the cheesecake is completely covered in cookie dough. Roll the cookie dough balls in pumpkin spice sugar.\n\nSTEP EIGHT: Transfer the cookie dough to a prepared baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake 6 cookies at a time. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the cookie sheet, then transfer the baked cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Then serve!\n\nFAQS\n\nWhy did my cookies come out cakey? The number one reason this could happen is because not enough moisture was removed from the pumpkin. It absolutely has to be pressed with paper towels prior to being added to the batter or the cookies will not bake properly. Wet cookie dough equals cakey cookies. The pumpkin should be dry enough that it goes from being ½ cup dried down to just under a ¼ cup. Hardly any liquid should transfer onto a paper towel once it has been dried enough. Like stated above, try to use Libby's canned pumpkin as almost all cans of it have the same consistency and are not too wet. Other brands of pumpkin can be really soupy in my opinion.\n\nCan I use my own pumpkin puree? I would say no because fresh pumpkin puree tends to be even more liquidy than canned. It may cause the cookies to bake incorrectly.\n\nHow do I store these cookies? Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to three days, or freeze them for up to two weeks!\n\nPRO TIPS\n\nFor best results, measure your flour properly. This is always my #1 baking tip. Do not ever scoop a measuring cup into your flour. This will always lead to using too much flour. Instead, sprinkle spoonfuls of flour into your measuring cup and swipe excess flour off with the back of a knife. Or better yet, weigh your flour. 1 cup of flour equals 125 grams.\n\nMake sure to completely freeze the cheesecake balls. This will ensure no cheesecake filling leaks out of the cookies while baking. Keep the cheesecake balls in the freezer just until you're ready to use for each batch of cookies.\n\nLet the cookies cool completely before eating. This will allow the cheesecake filling to firm up and not be runny.\n\nWhen the cookies are straight out of the oven, scoot a large circular cookie cutter around them to give them a perfect circular shape!\n\nMake sure to beat your eggs into the butter and sugar until the mixture is pale in color and fluffy, not just until it's combined. Doing this will help give you perfectly textured cookies.\n\nFor the Cheesecake Filling:\n\nLine a small cookie sheet with parchent paper.\n\nAdd the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla to a small bowl. Mix on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until fluffy and the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.\n\nScoop the cheesecake filling into 16, 2 teaspoon portions onto the baking sheet.\n\n(There will be a little bit left over in the bowl.)\n\nPop the cheesecake balls into the freezer until they are frozen and very firm.\n\nFor the Spiced Sugar:\n\nAdd the sugar and pumpkin pie spice to a small bowl. Whisk to combine then set aside.\n\nFor the Pumpkin Cookies:\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\nDry your pumpkin to get rid of excess moisture. This may seem weird but it is the only way these cookies will bake properly and not turn out cakey! Spread your pumpkin on a plate and place paper towels over the top. Lightly press to absorb the liquid. Repeat the step at least four more times until hardly any liquid transfers to the paper towel. (It needs to reduce down to just under ¼ cup from ½ cup). Then set aside.\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Then set aside the flour mixture.\n\nAdd in the egg yolks and vanilla and mix for one minute on medium speed until pale and fluffy.\n\nAdd in the dried pumpkin and combine on medium speed.\n\nAdd in the dry ingredients and combine on low speed.\n\nScoop the dough into 16 portions with a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop, then roll into balls. Slightly flatten out each then place a frozen cheesecake ball in the center. Then close the cheesecake ball in with the cookie dough and roll into a ball again. Make sure the cheesecake is completely covered in cookie dough. Roll the cookie dough balls in pumpkin spice sugar.\n\n(Keep the cheesecake balls in the freezer until ready to use for each batch of cookies.)\n\nTransfer the cookie dough balls to the prepared baking sheet. Bake 6 cookies at a time for 12-13 minutes.\n\nLet the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the cookie sheet, then transfer the baked cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Then serve!",

Drain the rice through a fine mesh sieve, reserving the stock and the rice.\n\nInvert a small metal bowl and place inside a larger metal bowl to create an elevated surface to cut the corn. Using a small paring knife, trim the corn from the cobs. After removing the kernels, using the back of the knife, scrape any remaining starchy liquid from the cobs. Set aside and reserve three of the stripped cobs.\n\nSet the pressure cooker to sauté or place over medium-high heat and preheat. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and melt until foamy, about 1 minute. Add the corn and sauté until tender and sweet, about 2 minutes. Remove the corn from the heat, return it to the bowl, and set it aside.\n\nIn the same pressure cooker, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter until foamy, about 1 minute. Add the minced shallots and garlic, cooking until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the rinsed rice and gently toast in the butter, about 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and cook until reduced and no raw alcohol taste remains, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock, bay leaf, thyme to the pot and season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Add the three reserved cobs to the liquid and close the pressure cooker. Bring to low pressure and cook for 4 minutes.\n\nWhile the risotto cooks, transfer half the sautéed corn to a blender canister along with the heavy cream and turmeric (if using). Blend until smooth and set aside.\n\nAfter the risotto has cooked, quickly depressurize the cooker by either submerging it under running cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam release valve if it is electric.\n\nOpen the pressure cooker and remove and dispose of the bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Remove the cobs, scraping the liquid from the cobs back into the risotto.\n\nAdd the corn purée, sautéed corn, and pecorino to the risotto and stir vigorously to develop a thick and creamy texture. Add more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Serve immediately, with more cheese if desired.',

Cook potato soup on LOW heat for 6 to 8 hours or HIGH for 3 to 4 hours.\n\nAdd the milk and cornstarch mixture.\n\nStir in the cheese and yogurt.\n\nMash about half of the potatoes directly in the slow cooker. Serve the soup with a few (or maybe a lot) of tasty toppings (more cheese, anyone?). ENJOY!\n\nTIP!\n\nIf you prefer a perfectly smooth potato soup without chucks, you can instead puree the soup with an immersion blender. I suggest doing this before adding the cheese and yogurt in step 4.\n\nStorage Tips\n\nTo Store. Keep your leftover soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\nTo Reheat. Warm in the microwave or stovetop with a splash of milk or chicken broth as needed until heated through.\n\nTo Freeze. To ensure this soup freezes well (potatoes can become mealy when frozen), I recommend making a few adjustments before sticking your leftovers in the freezer. Instead of mashing about half the potatoes in the slow cooker, you should mash almost all of them, which will help to deter the potatoes from becoming mealy (you may need to add more broth to thin the soup). Let the soup cool completely. Then, place leftover soup in a freezer-safe container in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before warming.\n\nLeftover Tip\n\nIf you want to enjoy your leftovers a little at a time, freeze portion-sized amounts of soup in multiple small containers.\n\nThe Fixins. For a tasty crockpot LOADED potato soup effect, top it off just like a baked potato: plain Greek yogurt (or sour cream), fresh chives, a sprinkle of bacon (Oven Baked Bacon and Air Fryer Bacon are the easiest ways to cook it), and (surprise!) extra cheese.\n\nBread. I splurged on a loaf of ciabatta at our neighborhood Italian market. It was perfect for mopping up every morsel. For homemade bread options, I love pairing it with Cheesy Jalapeno Cornbread.\n\nCrackers. A good stand-in for bread, they add a nice crunch. Try these delicious Ranch Crackers.\n\nMore Potatoes. While croutons would be tasty on top of this soup, Homemade Tater Tots would make a divine extra layer of crispy potato goodness.\n\nBig Green Salad. Try pairing this soup with this Caesar Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad with Crispy Chickpea Croutons for a light and fresh side.\n\nLightly coat a 6-quart or larger slow cooker with nonstick spray. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until softened, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently and adjusting the heat so that the onion does not crisp or turn dark brown. Add to the slow cooker.\n\nTo the slow cooker, add the carrots, potatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, cayenne, and 3 cups chicken broth. Stir to combine. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or high for 3 to 4 hours, until the potatoes and carrots are completely tender.\n\nWhile the vegetables cook, in a medium bowl, whisk together the evaporated milk and cornstarch until no lumps remain. During the last 30 minutes of cooking, add the cornstarch/milk mixture. Continue cooking for 30 additional minutes.\n\nJust before serving, stir in the shredded cheddar and Greek yogurt. With a potato masher or large spoon, mash half of the potatoes directly in the slow cooker. The soup will continue to thicken as it cools. If you would like the soup to be thinner, add the remaining 1 cup chicken broth until you reach your desired consistency (warm up the broth first). Stir to combine, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, topped with bacon, chives, and additional cheese/Greek yogurt as desired.',

			'*SUBSTITUTION TIP: If you plan to serve the soup with bacon, I suggest chopping it into bite-size pieces, then sautéing it in a large skillet over medium-low heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. Drain out all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings, then use it to sauté in the onions in place of the unsalted butter.\n\nTO STORE: Place leftover soup in an airtight storage container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\nTO REHEAT: Reheat in the microwave or on the stove with a splash of milk or chicken broth as needed until heated through.\n\nTO FREEZE: Instead of mashing about half the potatoes in the slow cooker during Step 4, you should mash almost all of them (you may need to add more broth to thin the soup).

			'I do not recommend overlapping the chicken pieces in this recipe. It’s best to have the chicken spaces in a single layer and not touching. That way the air can get around the chicken to crisp it up and give it that nice and crispy golden layer.\n\nRemember to spray lightly with oil. The purpose of the oil in this recipe is to cover the dried flour spots. Not spraying with oil will have those flour spots tasting like you would imagine they would, dry flour.\n\nSome breading will fall of, whether you use the liners or not. However, much less breading falls of when using the parchment liners.\n\nIf using parchment liners, make sure that you place the chicken on top of them before starting the Air Fryer. Not doing so will cause the liners to fly into the fan, get caught, and possibly start a fire.\n\nTiming will vary depending on Air Fryer brand. Use a meat thermometer to ensure your chicken has at least reached a temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. My chicken usually reaches 180 degrees or more and is still juicy and deliciousy crsip.\n\nThis chicken is best serve the same day. If reheating, place chicken in Air Fryer and cook on 370 for about 10 minutes.\n\nUse any part of the chicken you like that has skin on. The breading may not stick to skinless chicken and it may not be as crispy.',

It is best to buy a block of cheese and grate yourself because it will melt better.\n\nMilk and butter: I recommend to use whole milk 3.25% for maximum creaminess. 2% will work as well but less creamy.\n\nPrep before beginning to cook: This easy recipe comes together quick in one pot for. So, I recommend to have all ingredients prepped and ready to go before starting.\n\nToo much or little broth: If you notice your pasta is almost ready and there is still a lot of liquid, turn up the heat. Likewise, if you see pasta is not done and you are running out of liquid, add 1/4 cup at a time.\n\nCan I bake it? I don't recommend it because sauce will dry out. Baked versions need more cheese and sauce and seasonings respectively.",

			'In a small bowl, rinse the rice with the chicken stock, gently stirring with a spoon or rubber spatula. Drain the rice through a fine mesh sieve, reserving the stock and the rice.\n\nInvert a small metal bowl and place inside a larger metal bowl to create an elevated surface to cut the corn. Using a small paring knife, trim the corn from the cobs. After removing the kernels, using the back of the knife, scrape any remaining starchy liquid from the cobs. Set aside and reserve three of the stripped cobs.\n\nSet the pressure cooker to sauté or place over medium-high heat and preheat. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and melt until foamy, about 1 minute. Add the corn and sauté until tender and sweet, about 2 minutes. Remove the corn from the heat, return it to the bowl, and set it aside.\n\nIn the same pressure cooker, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter until foamy, about 1 minute. Add the minced shallots and garlic, cooking until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the rinsed rice and gently toast in the butter, about 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and cook until reduced and no raw alcohol taste remains, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock, bay leaf, thyme to the pot and season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Add the three reserved cobs to the liquid and close the pressure cooker. Bring to low pressure and cook for 4 minutes.\n\nWhile the risotto cooks, transfer half the sautéed corn to a blender canister along with the heavy cream and turmeric (if using). Blend until smooth and set aside.\n\nAfter the risotto has cooked, quickly depressurize the cooker by either submerging it under running cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam release valve if it is electric.\n\nOpen the pressure cooker and remove and dispose of the bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Remove the cobs, scraping the liquid from the cobs back into the risotto.\n\nAdd the corn purée, sautéed corn, and pecorino to the risotto and stir vigorously to develop a thick and creamy texture. Add more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Serve immediately, with more cheese if desired.',

Set aside 1/2 cup of the crumble mixture, then press the rest into an even layer in the bottom of the prepared pan.\n\nScatter half of the strawberries over the crust. Sprinkle the cornstarch evenly over the top, then sprinkle on the lemon juice and 1/2 tablespoon of the granulated sugar. Scatter on the remaining berries, then the remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar. Sprinkle the reserved crumbs evenly over the top. You will have some fruit showing through.\n\nBake the bars for 35 to 40 minutes, until the fruit is bubbly and the crumb topping smells toasty and looks golden. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool completely (you can speed this process along in the refrigerator).\n\nWhile the bars cool, prepare the glaze: In a medium bowl, briskly whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk until smooth. Feel free to add more milk if a thinner consistency is desired. Using the parchment-paper handles, lift the bars from the pan. Drizzle with glaze, slice, and serve.',

For an equally rich and delicious flavor profile, try swapping out the root beer for dry red wine or stout beer instead.• Don’t skip browning the meat. Browning beef before braising is essential to unlocking tons of incredible flavor, so don’t skip this step.• The veggies don’t need to be perfect. While your vegetables should be somewhat consistent in size, don’t worry if they aren’t exactly the same size. It’s not a big deal with braised beef recipes like this one if your veggies aren’t perfectly uniform.• Braised short ribs in the oven. Don’t have an Instant Pot? No problem. Cook this dish in an oven-safe pot, bring the ingredients to a boil, then cover and bake in a 300°F oven for 3 hours or until the ribs are fork-tender.• Braised short ribs in a slow cooker. You can easily turn this into a slow cooker beef recipe by adding the ingredients to a crockpot and cooking on low mode for 5-6 hours.',

			'Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.\n\nCombine the milk and butter together in a heatproof bowl. Microwave or use the stove and heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is warm to the touch (about 110°F/43°C, no higher). Whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved. Pour mixture into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir with a sturdy rubber spatula or wooden spoon OR use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed. Mix until a soft dough forms.\n\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Using floured hands, knead the dough for 3 minutes. You should have a smooth ball of dough. If the dough is super soft or sticky, you can add a little more flour. Place in a lightly greased bowl (I use non-stick spray), cover loosely, and let the dough rest for about 10 minutes as you get the filling ingredients ready.\n\nFill the rolls: After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14×8-inch (36×20-cm) rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and brown sugar. Sprinkle it all over the dough. Roll up the dough to make a 14-inch log. Cut into 10–12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9- or 10-inch round cake pan, pie dish, or square baking pan.\n\nRise: Cover the pan with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the rolls to rise in a relatively warm environment for 60–90 minutes or until double in size. (For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)\n\nBake the rolls: After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 24–27 minutes, or until lightly browned. If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking. If you want to be precise about their doneness, their internal temperature taken with an instant read thermometer should be around 195–200°F (91–93°C) when done. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack as you make the icing. (You can also make the icing as the rolls bake.)\n\nMake the icing: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add the butter and beat until smooth and combined, then beat in the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until combined. Using a knife or icing spatula, spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately.\n\nCover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.',

			'Make Ahead Instructions: This dough can be made the night before through step 4. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator overnight. The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise in a warm environment, about 1 hour. Continue with step 6.\n\nFreezing Instructions: Baked rolls can be frozen up to 2–3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here’s how: bake the rolls in step 6 for only about 10 minutes at 375°F (190°C). Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze. To serve, take the pan of rolls out of the freezer and put into the refrigerator a few hours before serving. Then, finish baking them for the remaining 15–18 minutes.\n\nYeast: I highly recommend instant yeast. If you only have active dry yeast, you can use that instead. Active dry and instant yeast can be used interchangeably in recipes (1:1). Active dry yeast has a moderate rate of rising and instant dry yeast has a faster rate of rising; active dry yeast will take longer to raise the dough.\n\nMilk: This recipe used to call for 1/2 cup (120ml) milk and 1/4 cup (60ml) water. The rolls taste much richer using all milk, and that is what I recommend. Whole milk or even buttermilk are ideal for this dough. If needed, you can substitute 3/4 cup (180ml) lower-fat or nondairy milk.',

Sprinkle the sundried tomatoes and basil in the bottom of each cup. Fill each cup about 3/4 of the way full.\n\nCover the silicone molds tightly with foil. Add 2 cups of water to the Instant Pot and place the trivet on the bottom of the pan. Carefully stack the molds on top of the trivet slightly offset so that the cups are not directly on top of each other.\n\nCook on high pressure using the steam function for 8 minutes. Let the pressure naturally release. This took about 10 minutes. Remove the silicone molds and let cool. The sous vide eggs rise a bit while cooking but settle as they cool. Remove the foil and pop theegg bites out of the mold. Store in an air tight container for up to 1 week in the refrigerator. Microwave for 30 seconds when ready to eat.\n\nFor the oven, prepare as directed in recipe and pour into greased mini-muffin tin. Cook at 375 degrees for 20 minutes with a casserole dish of water on the shelf below. More tips are in the post above.',

			'Proof the yeast. Add warm water (about 110°F, which you can measure with a thermometer if you want to be sure it’s the right temp) and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough attachment, and stir to combine. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water. Give the yeast a quick stir to mix it in with the water. Then let it sit for 5-10 minute until the yeast is foamy.\n\nKnead the dough. (See alterate instructions below to knead by hand.) Set the mixer to low speed, and add gradually flour, olive oil and salt. Increase speed to medium-low, and continue mixing the dough for 5 minutes. (If the dough is too sticky and isn’t pulling away from the sides of the bowl, add in an extra 1/4 cup flour while it is mixing.)\n\nFirst dough rise. Remove dough from the mixing bowl, and use your hands to shape it into a ball. Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) with olive oil or cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel. Place in a warm location (I set mine by a sunny window) and let the dough rise for 45-60 minutes, or until it has nearly doubled in size.\n\nSecond dough rise. Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and roll it out into a large circle or rectangle until that the dough is about 1/2-inch thick*. Cover the dough again with the damp towel, and let the dough continue to rise for another 20 minutes.\n\nPrepare the dough. Preheat oven to 400°F. Transfer the dough to a large parchment-covered baking sheet (or press it into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish). Use your fingers to poke deep dents (seriously, poke all the way down to the baking sheet!) all over the surface of the dough. Drizzle a tablespoon or two of olive oil evenly all over the top of the dough, and sprinkle evenly with the fresh rosemary needles and sea salt.\n\nBake. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the dough is slightly golden and cooked through.\n\nServe. Remove from the oven, and drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired. Slice, and serve warm.',

			'Flaky vs. fine sea salt: If you do not have flaky sea salt on hand, no worries, you can definitely sub in fine sea salt. Just be sure to use about half the amount of salt (if using fine sea salt) so that the bread is not too salty.\n\nTo knead the dough by hand: Complete step 1 in a large mixing bowl. Gradually stir in the flour, olive oil and salt until a shaggy dough begins to form. Then turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for 5 minutes until smooth, adding extra flour if the dough feels too sticky. Continue on with the recipe as directed.\n\nBread thickness: I like my focaccia to be a bit on the thicker side. But if you prefer yours thinner, just roll it out a little more. It will rise up considerably while baking.',
