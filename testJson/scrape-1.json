	"instructions": "Mash the anchovies: In a small bowl, add the anchovy and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Use a fork to mash the anchovy until dissolved in the oil. I like to use a wooden bowl because I find it easier to mash the anchovy against its textured sides. Simply Recipes / Lori Rice\nAdd the vegetables and seasonings: In a medium bowl, add the mashed anchovy with the oil, kalamata and green olives, celery, carrot, cauliflower, garlic, capers, red wine vinegar, oregano, and black pepper. Stir to combine. Simply Recipes / Lori Rice\nAdd olive oil and marinate: Add enough olive oil to just cover the salad. For the best flavor, let it marinate for at least 1 hour at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. Stir the salad, taste, and add more black pepper or vinegar if you’d like. It probably does not need more salt because the olives, anchovy, and capers are salty enough. You will have about 4 cups of olive salad, of which you will use about 2 cups in the sandwich. Think of the leftovers as a gift for tossing with pasta, to spoon over cream cheese for dipping, or to make another muffuletta! It will keep, covered in oil and refrigerated, for at least 1 month. Simply Recipes / Lori Rice\nPrepare the bread: Slice the loaf of bread in half horizontally and use your hands to hollow out each half by removing the soft bread inside. This will create cavities for the filling. Leave 1/2-inch of soft bread near the crust, taking care not to tear through the crust. Simply Recipes / Lori Rice\nSpread the olive salad: Stir the salad once more to reincorporate the oil and seasonings, then spread about 2 cups total on the 2 pieces of bread. Use the back of a spoon to really smoosh it down into the bread, covering the entire surface. Simply Recipes / Lori Rice\nAssemble the meats and cheeses: Layer the salami, capicola, mortadella, mozzarella, and provolone on the bottom piece of bread. Carefully flip the top piece of bread on top. Simply Recipes / Lori RiceSimply Recipes / Lori RiceSimply Recipes / Lori RiceSimply Recipes / Lori Rice\nWrap it and let it rest: Tightly wrap the muffuletta with foil and allow it to sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature for the flavors to marry and the oil to soak into the bread. Simply Recipes / Lori RiceSimply Recipes / Lori Rice\nServe: Remove the foil and cut the muffuletta into 4 wedges and serve. Tightly wrap any leftover sandwich with plastic wrap or foil and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The leftover olive salad will keep for 1 month if covered with olive oil in a sealed container in the refrigerator. Did you love the recipe? Leave us stars below! Simply Recipes / Lori Rice",
