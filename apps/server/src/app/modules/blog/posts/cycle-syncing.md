# Cycle Syncing

"Cycle Syncing” is an important topic that is starting to get more attention. As a young girl, you aren’t really taught how to understand and nourish your body throughout your monthly cycle when the reality is you have different movement and nutritional needs at different phases.

The framework of cycle syncing can easily be thought of as the seasons.

## Menstrual phase

Estrogen is low and on the rise. It’s best to stick with soothing drinks and foods and limit fatty foods. Rest is key – focus on yoga and restorative walks.

## Follicular phase

Hormone levels are still relatively low. Focus on sprouted and fermented foods and light cardio. Stamina may be low still due to your hormone levels.

## Ovulatory phase

Estrogen is at its highest. This is the best time for a big salad with raw veggies, fruits, and nuts. Energy is usually higher too so challenge yourself with HIIT or circuit training.

## Luteal

As your body prepares for another menstrual phase and your hormone levels destabilize, your energy levels may drop. Your body will be craving magnesium-rich foods like pumpkin seeds and dark chocolate. I tend to stick to warm grains and leafy greens.

It was always normalized to indulge during your menstrual cycle with sweets and beyond, but there’s an actual biological basis for your chocolate cravings and comfort foods. Your body is telling you how it wants to be loved, let’s listen.

## Brownie Recipe

Here’s a brownie recipe that will help you thrive in the luteal phase and coincidentally “seasonally appropriate” with the pumpkin or sweet potato!
